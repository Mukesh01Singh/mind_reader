# 🧠 Mind Reader – A Fun JavaScript Number Trick!

This is a simple but magical web-based project that reads your mind — or at least makes it feel like it does! 😉  
Built using basic **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project is a great way to practice **arrays**, **DOM manipulation**, and **event handling**.



## 🛠️ How It Works

The trick uses a basic mathematical pattern:

> 1. Think of a number  
> 2. Multiply it by 2  
> 3. Add 10  
> 4. Divide by 2  
> 5. Subtract your original number  
> 6. 🎉 The answer is always **5**!

This project displays each step one-by-one using an array of instructions, making the interaction engaging and magical.
